# The Everysport Scoreboard

The Everysport Scoreboard lets the user browse results, standings and schedules from [Everysport](http://everysport.com). 

The Scoreboard is a JavaScript Widget that is easy to embed on any web site with just a few lines of code. It's designed for responsive Web sites: data is loaded in the background and the layout adapts to the size of the screen. 

This documentation covers the following areas:

1. [Getting Started](/getting-started.md) - display a basic Scoreboard on a Web page;
2. [Presentation](/presentation.md) - change fonts and width;
3. [Today's Games](/games-of-today.md) - display list of today's games.
4. [Trend Tables](/trend-tables.md) - activating the Trend Tables. 
5. [Tables only](/tables.md) - displays the table only for a specific league.
