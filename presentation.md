# Presentation

Some presentational attributes of the Scoreboard can be changed with standard CSS:
* Font family (i.e. typeface)
* Font size 
* Width
* Margin and paddings

By default the Scoreboard inherits its style from the CSS of its  parents. 

The following CSS code sets the font-size to exactly 12px, the font family to Serif and the width to 280px: 

```html
	div.everysport-scoreboard {
		width: 280px;
		font-size: 12px; 
		margin: 1em auto;
		font-family: serif; 
	}
```
