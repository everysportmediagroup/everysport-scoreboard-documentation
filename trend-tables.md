# Activating Trend-tables

Trend-tables are diagrams that show the team's position in the last N rounds of the league. It makes it easy to track whether a team is on its way up or down in the league. See demo [here](http://scoreboard.everysport.com/#Fotboll,Allsvenskan).

Trend-tables are activated with the ```data-trend```-attribute. 

```html
<div class="everysport-scoreboard" data-trend="true"></div>
```
